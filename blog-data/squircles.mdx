# Squircles

**Squircle** is an interesting curve shape, that sits between circle and rectangle.

## What is a squircle ?

A squircle is a geometric shape that is in between the shape of a square and a circle that's why the name is **squircle (square + circle)**.

## Where did i see squircles for the first time?

If you have ever used any **samsung's** mobile then you would have noticed their **one ui** uses squircles to show icons. These icons are not perfectly circular or square but they are in between the two shapes which is called **squircle**.

## Squircles vs Rounded Squares

A rounded square just has rounded corners, on the other hand a squircle has rounded edges

Here you can see the difference between a squircle, circle and a square. The squircle is not actually perfectly rounded at the corners like a rounded square of rectangle.

## How to create a squircle?

We can create a squircle using the `corner-shape` property in CSS. This property allows us to specify the shape of the corners of an element. To create a squircle, we can set the `corner-shape` property to `squircle`. However, since not all browsers may support this property, we can use a fallback method by setting the `border-radius` to 50% to create a circular shape.

```CSS
  .squircle {
    corner-shape: squircle;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }
```

## Why use squircles?

Squircles are a great way to add a modern and sleek look to your designs. They can be used in various applications such as icons, buttons, and even in typography. Squircles can also help to create a more cohesive and visually appealing design by providing a consistent shape that is not too harsh like a square or too soft like a circle.

### Where have i used squircles?

Well i have used squircles in this portfolio itself. If you go and have a look at the contact page you will see that the icons are in the shape of squircles. I have used the same shape for all the icons to maintain consistency and to give a modern look to the design.
