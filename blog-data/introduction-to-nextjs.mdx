# Introduction to Next.js

Next.js is a powerful open-source React framework developed by Vercel. It simplifies building modern web applications by offering features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes.

## Why Choose Next.js?

- **Performance:** SSR and SSG deliver fast load times and improved SEO.
- **File-based Routing:** Each file in the `pages` directory becomes a route, making navigation simple.
- **Versatility:** Supports TypeScript, CSS modules, and image optimization.
- **API Routes:** Build backend functionality without a separate server.

## Getting Started

To start with Next.js, install it using npm:

```bash
npm install next react react-dom
